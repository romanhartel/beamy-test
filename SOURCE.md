# Beamy technical test

## Guidelines

- Solve the levels in ascending order
- Only do one commit per level and include the `.git` when submiting your test
- Do not upload the technical test to a public git repository

Please do the simplest thing that could work for the level you're currently solving.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is:

- Clean
- Extensible
- Reliable
- Reproducible on every environment (using docker for example)

We should be able to run each level with as few commands as possible (using Makefile for example), and you should provide us clear guideline on how to run your code.
If you think that you need tests, do not hesitate to add some!

If you don't succeed to solve a level, explain us how you would have done it

## Challenge

The challenge needs to be resolved in Typescript.
Each level depends on one Node v18 executable and one to many libraries that you'll have to use.
**You can't modify them.**
Your solution to each level needs to live in the `level{N}` directory.

The purpose of the whole project is to handle logs, these logs look like this:

```
id=0060cd38-9dd5-4eff-a72f-9705f3dd25d9 service_name=api process=api.233 sample#load_avg_1m=0.849 sample#load_avg_5m=0.561 sample#load_avg_15m=0.202
```

## Level 1

Before everything, you'll need to do a `npm install`.

Here you need to write a simple HTTP server that will listen to POST requests on the port 3000 and that will receive logs one by one.

It will parse each sent log and write the result to a JSON file in `./parsed/#{id}.json`. You need to write a JSON in the following format:

```
{
  "id": "2acc4f33-1f80-43d0-a4a6-b2d8c1dbbe47",
  "service_name": "web",
  "process": "web.1089",
  "load_avg_1m": "0.04",
  "load_avg_5m": "0.10",
  "load_avg_15m": "0.31"
}
```

To write a simple HTTP server look at [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

Then you can launch the `npm run logs:emit` command, it will send log messages to the server you have build.

**An important point to consider is that in this command, the POST requests will timeout after 1s.**

## Level 2

This time your HTTP server need to parse the logs and send them to a Redis `LIST` on a local Redis instance (redis://localhost:6379).

Your HTTP server, after parsing the logs, needs to enrich them with a library called `slowComputation`. Each computation done via this operation should last some time, here more than 1 second.

To understand how to use this library, you can look at the `exampleCompute.ts` file.

Youâ€™ll send the resulting JSON in a redis LIST.

Again, you can launch the `npm run logs:emit` command, it will have the same timeout constraint.
